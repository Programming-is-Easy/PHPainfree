## How to contribute to PHPainfree
#### **Did you find a bug?**
* **Check to see if it has already been reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/Programming-is-Easy/PHPainfree/issues).
* If you're unable to find an issue addressing the problem, [create a new one]([https://github.com/rails/rails/issues](https://github.com/Programming-is-Easy/PHPainfree/issues)/new). Be sure to include a **title and description**, with as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

#### **Did you write a patch to fix a bug?**
* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.
* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

#### **Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?**
Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the stability, functionality, or testability of PHPainfree will generally not be accepted.

#### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**
* Suggest your change as a new issue and label it as a Feature Suggestion in the [PHPainfree Issues](https://github.com/Programming-is-Easy/PHPainfree/issues).
* If your suggestion is accepted, feel free to start writing code and submit a PR when you're finished.

#### **Do you have questions about the source code?**
* Ask any question about how to use PHPainfree in the [Programming is Easy Discord Server](https://programming-is-easy.com/discord).

#### **Do you want to contribute an example, recipe, or improve documentation?**

* Feel free to submit your code directly and label it as either "Example", "Recipe", or "Documentation". There will probably be a lengthy discussion in the PR to find the best way to incorporate your changes. If it is a class file designed to serve as an example, you will be required to include documentation for how to use it in the main web application provided with PHPainfree inside the `/docs` route.

Thanks!
